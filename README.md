# VCW Weather Station - Server
Software that makes the website for [VCW](https://valleyworkspace.org) weather stations.

The weather station hardware and firmware currently live at https://github.com/MoonbaseOtago/indoor-weather-station-v2 , however we plan to move them both to the ValleyCommunityWorkspace github account at some stage.

[The Wiki](https://github.com/ValleyCommunityWorkspace/weather-station-server/wiki) for this repository has more documentation.
